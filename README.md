This project is for the UNCC Charlotte AI Research organization. It is for the purpose of automating tasks in discord such as answering basic questions about the club, meeting times, announcements etc. I have never worked with the discord.py API so I am currently following along with the tutorial from Real Python: https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/.

I plan to either build from scratch or utilize other APIs to take a more generalized approach and people do not have to stick to strict commands for unknown questions that may arise later.
